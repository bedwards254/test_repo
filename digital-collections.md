# Digital Collections

Rose Library collection born digital materials and digitizes materials for preservation purposes. 
All digitized and born digital materials can be accessed on laptops or iPads in our Reading Room.

Digitized collections are available online via Emory’s [Digital Gallery](<http://www.digitalgallery.emory.edu/luna/servlet>
 "http://www.digitalgallery.emory.edu/luna/servlet"). 

## Salman Rushdie Born-Digital Laptop:

The Rose Library provides access to the processed portions of [Salman Rushdie’s digital archive](<https://findingaids.library.emory.edu/documents/rushdie1000/> 
"https://findingaids.library.emory.edu/documents/rushdie1000/") via a 
laptop in the reading room. This workstation allows researchers to search and browse Rushdie’s computing files, 
as well as interact with a simulation of Rushdie’s original computing environment via an emulation. As additional
data from Rushdie's computers are processed, they will also be available in the Reading Room.

## Born-Digital Collections

In addition to providing access to the processed portions of Rushdie’s digital archive, Rose Library also provides 
access to other processed born-digital collections on laptops in the Rose Library Reading Room. Currently available collections
are listed below.Born-digital files 
from the papers of Alice Walker, Lucille Clifton, Turner Cassity, Mildred Thompson, Nathaniel Mackey and Matt Schaffer 
collections. are currently available, with other collections soon to be added.

Patrons may request access to unprocessed born digital collections that appear in the [Emory FindingAids database](<https://findingaids.library.emory.edu> "https://findingaids.library.emory.edu"), 
though all requests must be made in advance. Once a request is made, we will supply the patron with a time estimate 
for how long it will take to make the material available in the reading room. The turnaround time varies widely 
based on original file and media formats. Restrictions on a given collection, copyright limitations, or technology 
complications may hinder Rose Library's ability to provide access to unprocessed born digital collections. To request 
access to unprocessed born digital collections, please email [rose.library@emory.edu](<rose.library@emory.edu> "rose.library@emory.edu").
