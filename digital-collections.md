# Digital Collections

Rose Library collects born digital materials and digitizes materials for preservation purposes. 
All digitized and born digital materials can be accessed on laptops or iPads in our Reading Room.

## Born-Digital Collections

Born-digital materials are items created electronically and do not have a physical form. They require another way to view them, such as a laptop or iPad, rather than physically holding the material. For example, think of files you create on your computer or photographs on your phone. These files cannot be viewed without an electronic device; and, if you were to print out said photograph or file, it would then be an analog form of the material, which has different properties than the digital form.  

There is a different between born-digital and digitized materials. Digitized materials are reproductions of physical items, most often accomplished through a scanner or a camera. Think of it like scanning a form with your signature to then email to someone. That's an example of digitization! Digitized collections are available online via Emory’s [Digital Gallery](<http://www.digitalgallery.emory.edu/luna/servlet>
 "http://www.digitalgallery.emory.edu/luna/servlet"). 

Rose Library provides access to other processed born-digital collections on laptops in the Rose Library Reading Room. Currently available collections are listed below. 

Patrons may request access to unprocessed born digital collections that appear in the [Emory FindingAids database](<https://findingaids.library.emory.edu> "https://findingaids.library.emory.edu"), 
though all requests must be made in advance. Once a request is made, we will supply the patron with a time estimate 
for how long it will take to make the material available in the reading room. The turnaround time varies widely 
based on original file and media formats. Restrictions on a given collection, copyright limitations, or technology 
complications may hinder Rose Library's ability to provide access to unprocessed born digital collections. To request 
access to unprocessed born digital collections, please email [rose.library@emory.edu](<rose.library@emory.edu> "rose.library@emory.edu").

## Salman Rushdie Born-Digital Laptop:

The Rose Library provides access to the processed portions of [Salman Rushdie’s digital archive](<https://findingaids.library.emory.edu/documents/rushdie1000/> 
"https://findingaids.library.emory.edu/documents/rushdie1000/") via a 
laptop in the reading room. This workstation allows researchers to interact with a simulation of Rushdie’s original 
computing environment via an emulation. As additional
data from Rushdie's computers are processed, they will also be available in the Reading Room.
