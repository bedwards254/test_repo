## Introduction 
Ever see a theatre production and wish you could relive it, or see the thought processes behind 
the design or drafts of costume sketches? Have you thought there might be an archive for this 
sort of thing? Theatre archives are a thing many have not heard of, yet they exist in dark corners 
of theatres all over the world. From playbills to set and costume designs to posters, these 
materials pile up and show the compiled history of the theatres which hold them. Some are held 
in-house, some in a wider community archive, and some even exist inside larger institutions, 
such as a university library or special collections. Others exist in private collections of those who 
worked in these theatres and look fondly back on them. However, by being separate, the archive 
is decentralized and the whole history of the theatre is scattered, making it hard to have a full 
narrative of the company. </br>
This is where the American Theatre Archive Project (ATAP) comes in. Supporting the archives 
of an inherently ephemeral art is a courageous endeavor, and it takes a village made up of 
archivist and theatre practitioners alike. ATAP is comprised of regional teams, which go out and 
consult with theatres to help them come up with a plan for their archival materials. This plan can 
either be donation to a repository, in which case ATAP will help arrange, or create their own 
archive, which ATAP representatives and team members will help guide them through the 
process and provide resources and assistance when needed. North Carolina has a regional team, 
with the team leader from the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. This central location 
in the state, and a partnership with Duke, seems to be ideal for the project to take shape. 
However, due to circumstances beyond its control, the team has not been able to do as much as 
they have wanted in the years they have existed, excluding an interest survey at the beginning of 
the project. </br>
While there is an abundance of theatres within the Triangle (Raleigh, Durham, Chapel Hill) of 
North Carolina, not a lot of them have archives, or at least publicly known archives. What I 
intend to look into is the presence, if any, of theatre archives in the Triangle area of North 
Carolina, and also to see if these theatres are aware of programs such as ATAP to help them start 
one for their company if they so wish. </br>
### Research Questions 
* Do local Triangle theatres (professional and amateur) know about ATAP, and if so, how 
have they interacted with ATAP/benefitted from this knowledge? 
*	How has ATAP influenced the Triangle theatre scene, if at all? </br>

## Literature Review </br>
To understand theatre archives, an explanation of community archives and performing arts 
archives/special collections is needed. Another important aspect to be considered is why these 
types of collections are important to help preserve the cultural memory of a theatre or 
surrounding community. This section will end with a summary of the American Theatre Archive 
Project (ATAP) as a whole, and a brief overview of the history and work done by the North 
Carolina team specifically. </br>
### Community Archives </br>
The impact and awareness of community archives has become more and more recognized in 
professional literature over the past 10 years. From implementation, to building, to evaluation, 
the archives field has seen this trend grow, with new initiatives being thought up every week. 
The term Òcommunity archive,Ó as defined by Joanna Newman in 2011, represents the 
Òcollections of archival records that originate in a community...and whose collection, 
maintenance and use involves active participation of that communityÓ (p. 38). The mention of 
maintenance and use in this definition shows the importance of community archives, and how 
they should exist independently of the institution which helped create them. Funding is always a 
factor in how these archives continue but having someone Òwith skills and possibly specialist 
servicesÓ supported in order to not lose the Òpassion and connection...brought by enthusiastsÓ is 
just as important (Newman, 2011, p. 41). Bringing the community together at the beginning and 
encouraging interest in the archive can help lay a foundation to help support the archive later on. 
This impact is felt most when a ÒgapÓ in the narrative is filled; a group underrepresented in the 
community places their mark in history, a forgotten, or misremembered, piece of the past is 
uncovered, or someone discovers new information about their own family. These moments bring 
together communities and excite them about what else their collective history might uncover. 
Communities allowed to make Òcollective decisions about what is of enduring value to them, 
shape collective memories of their own pasts, and control the means through which stories about 
their past are constructed,Ó create more complete archives, and end up being more useful to the 
community in the long run, due to the input from the beginning (Caswell, Cifor, & Ramirez, 
2016, p. 61). Community archives can help build a larger, more complete history of a place, 
institution, or group with these stories which come to light, providing a stronger sense of self 
value and worth. The impact of saying Òwe were here,Ó and having materials and history to back 
up that claim, especially if previously undocumented, adds to the value of a community and can 
encourage them to keep saying ÒI am here,Ó adding to their identity (Caswell et al., 2016, p. 75). 
Bringing forward these stories help communities define themselves and see themselves in a 
different light, and in a different way in how they interact with the world around them. 
Mostly supported by institutions in getting started with a community archive, what happens 
when the institution must pull-away from the project to work on others? Who will keep the 
archive alive and running, and making it a worthwhile investment for the community? Has there 
even been an impact to which people would want to keep it running? Coming up with ways to 
keep the archive active is a challenge most community archives face once their founding partner 
pulls back for whatever reason. Being an agent for your cause is important, and a Òparticipatory 
approachÓ can help those left in charge to navigate these programs head-on. </br>
A Òparticipatory approachÓ involves allowing different views of Òcustody and management, 
and...archival practice, and of collection and value [that] are considered and embracedÓ (Flinn & 
Andrew, 2011, p. 15). This leads to a wider area of thought and acceptance to really make their 
community archive their own, especially if those leading it are open to these ideas. This 
approach can also open up the possibilities of partnerships with other similar institutions, or even 
with local businesses, to help support and nurture these archives. By partnering with businesses, 
other groups, or even schools, this collaboration can help foster a Òwider sense of ownership and 
responsibility toward the archive and the archive service,Ó which can help sustain interest in the 
long run (Flinn & Andrew, 2011, p. 1). This approach also gives community members the 
chance Òto speak for themselves and decide whether they wish to be included [in the archive],Ó 
which feeds into letting them control their own community narrative and how they are 
represented in history (Flinn & Andrew, 2011, p. 17). This also allows for the community to 
have a chance to speak and let their voices be heard in their own history, while shaping it to 
impact the history of other communities around them. The same could be said for theatre 
performances, and the buildings which they are in. </br>
### Performing Arts Collections in Archives </br>
Performing arts collections have been in libraries and special collections for some time now, 
with the most notable being the New York Public Library for the Performing Arts and the Harry 
Ransom Center in Austin, Texas. Ranging from music to theatre to dance, these collections tend 
to feature a wide variety of formats, from AV materials to dance notation to dramaturgy notes to 
set models and costumes. </br>
Though the materials found in collections themselves have not changed much over the past 50 
years, approaches to these materials have varied, especially in how they are used and cared for. 
An article on theatre librarianship by George Freedley in 1962 shines light on how three students 
in a workshop would handle performing arts materials coming in to different settings, which 
provides insight into priorities and levels of importance (Freedley, 1962). The students discussed 
the different spaces which their theatre collections resided in, ranging from public libraries to a 
theatre library, specific to a company or club, and what they would do with items such as 
playbills, books, photographs, and original designs (Freedley, 1962, p. 54-55). Comparing these 
recommendations from the students to articles written on performing arts archives today show 
how far performing arts collections have come, in terms of people interested in them and what 
they contain. </br>
Performing arts archives and collections have evolved over time, as well as the challenges in 
Òcreating and curating representations of an ephemeral art form,Ó since these representations 
vary from art form to art form (Jones, Abbott, & Ross, 2009, p. 165). With the evolution of 
technology, performances have evolved as well, becoming more complex and harder to capture 
in a single form. What used to be just a script and costumes is now projections, lighting plots, 
scenic panels, and fly cues. Though there is no formal standard on how to represent these types 
of collections, the formation and evolution of professional organizations have helped archivists 
realize the Òstandardization of practice was possible without compromising the uniqueness of 
collectionsÓ (Fern, 2004, p. 198). This has allowed archivists nationwide to create a general 
standard, and to still be able to represent their collections in their own way, based upon what 
types of materials they have and the institutional knowledge of how they might be used. 
A question which plagues theatre archives can also be applied to community and Òpop-upÓ 
archives. How to capture all of these moving elements faithfully, and in full detail? For 
performing arts archives, this can refer to different performances and audience reactions or to 
each rendition of the script as different parts are cut and added back in throughout the rehearsal 
process, capturing each change as it moves. These questions are also asked of community 
archivists, especially those which form around protests or other highly publicized emotional 
events, such as Occupy Wall Street. These dramatic events cause archivists to ask, ÒHow do you 
capture the mood of the time or reflect what it meant to take part in or live through such 
experiences?Ó (Jones et al., 2009, p. 167). Recreating the experience of actually being there is 
nigh impossible, but at the core, this is what archivists want their collections to capture - the 
feelings and the atmosphere of those who were. However, records and accounts are constantly 
evolving, in both settings, with new items and viewpoints being donated at all times, capturing a 
wide range of perspectives. For communities, this means adding in a wider set of experiences 
and drawing connections from other items in collections. For performing arts archives, this 
includes different accounts and reflections of one performance of a show, or different 
interpretations of a singular source material as it continues to be performed (Jones et al., 2009, 
page 169). Both types of archives must be open to constant change and use to be considered 
effective and relevant to their respective communities. </br>
Choosing what to keep in a performing arts archive can vary by what the particular focus is, what 
materials are available, and the resources needed to help maintain the collections in the best 
shape possible. These can include audio and video recordings, Òmanuscripts, photographs, and 
artworkÓ related to theatres in these collections, which can help Òdocument and support researchÓ 
(Russell, 2016, p. 63). However, these can also include items such as set models, costumes, 
scripts, and even potentially props from specific shows, if deemed important enough. These 
materials, along with ephemeral items, help historians Òreconstruct what Gordon Craig describes 
as the artistry of theatre: the Ôaction, scene, and voiceÕ,Ó which helps bring the production to life 
in the researcher's mind (Harvey & Moosberger, 2007, p. 44). However, deciding what to keep 
from a donation to fully represent a performance can be a challenge. </br>
A poster by Kathryn J. Hujda at the Society of American Archivists Annual Meeting 2017, titled 
ÒBut is it Archival? Determining Research Value,Ó broke down the decision process, along with 
how the term Òresearch valueÓ can differ between different collections. For example, she chose 
to list items with Òpermanent research valueÓ for both the Literary Archives and the Performing 
Arts Archives at the University of Minnesota to show how items can have different value, 
depending on the collection they are in. For example, scrapbooks and ephemera could have more 
research value to those with a performing arts focus, rather than to researchers with a literary 
focus (Hujda, SAA 2017). This breakdown really showcases what researchers find valuable, and 
the process she uses to determine if an item which comes in would be helpful to future research. 
Research value is vital to consider, since otherwise, there could be materials in the archive which 
donÕt fully help a researcher understand a show or overwhelms them to the point where they 
canÕt find any information. With the mix of materials found in these archives (mentioned 
previously), items range from small and seemingly insignificant, to larger items, vital to 
understanding a decision made for a certain production of a show by the director or designers. 
However, even with all this information, there can still be aspects missing from the record, such 
as the Òsubtle interactions between artist, venue, and audience that add character and vitality to 
live art,Ó which cannot be replicated, and varies from performance to performance (Jackson, 
Wheeler, & Quinn, 2015, p. 22). This is where records such as audience narratives or responses 
in journals can come in handy, and for stage and house manager reports to be collected as well. 
These are all different types of data, while not considered data by some, which can be important 
to researchers wishing to find the impact of a specific show or performance. Context is also 
important to consider, taking in outside factors such as the Òsocial, political, economic, and 
artistic contextsÓ to fully understand a performance and why certain choices were made in 
response to the surrounding climate (Marini, 2007, p. 20). Audience reaction also falls into the 
context field, with each audience reacting differently and each performance shaping and 
responding to the energy provided by the audience. </br>
Since Òperformance is something that does not last...[and this] is exactly what fascinates theatre 
practitioners and scholars alike,Ó the research process for these groups is influenced by this fact 
(Marini, 2007, p. 18). Accepting that performance is ephemeral can help inspire new 
interpretations of classic works, creating a new experience each time for audiences. Another 
unique aspect to these archives is that Òperforming arts librarians and archivists are often 
themselves practitioners,Ó which brings a different Òlevel of interest and engagement to the 
research processÓ (Jackson et al., 2015, p. 21). This personal touch helps elevate the work of a 
researcher with these connections and experiences provided by the archivist. It can also help in 
explaining certain aspects of a lighting or stage plan to users, who might not have the 
background in theatre to fully understand the technical side of things, or fully dissect costume or 
set sketches (Marini, 2007, p. 26). This knowledge of both theatre and archival work also lends 
itself to better advocacy for both disciplines, by knowing how to engage an audience, and how to 
preserve history and make it accessible for future use. </br>
### Advocacy for Community Archives and Theatre Archives 
Memory is important to the human race; stories we pass down shape who we are and those who 
come after us and their views of the world. Sometimes, these memories are lost through war, 
budget cuts, or even pure neglect. This is where advocacy for collections, especially community 
archives, and for the root from which they stem, comes in as an important aspect of the arts and 
archives both. Hackman proclaims he thinks of Òadvocacy as an investment we make when we 
intentionally and strategically educate and engage individuals and organizations so they in turn 
will support our work,Ó which can be seen in the continued existence and growth of community 
and theatre archives (Hackman, 2012, p. 11). Think of a successful theatre you know, either 
locally run, or a university or regional theatre; what do they do to stay successful? They engage 
with the community around them, offer community or summer classes, and bring together people 
from all walks of life, gaining supporters and loyal audience members by producing content 
people want to see. </br>
Archives are similar - they bring in new users all the time with their collections, they engage the 
community with outreach events, and they gain a loyal base who will help support them in rough 
times. If itÕs a community archive, this support goes even deeper, maybe even to the governing 
level, as seen in Lisa Collins ShortallÕs 2016 article on the County Offaly archives in Ireland. 
Even with all this support, advocacy is important to include in normal operations, making sure 
your mission and message are clear on all fronts and maintain strong relationships, not just to the 
archive or theatre itself. Community archives in particular have an importance in Òshaping the 
local historical narrative, collective identity and social memory of a localityÓ (Collins Shortall, 
2016, p. 144). In a way, where institutional archives have gaps, community archives can form 
and fill in those gaps, by collecting unheard narratives and objects institutions may not be able to 
take in at a certain time. Location could also play a part in this, with the Òdesire to physically 
secure...archival collections in a geographical provenance-based locationÓ showing the 
importance of the collections to the community and how they would like to have them on hand, 
to both care for and to use at will (Collins Shortall, 2016, p. 150). Some theatre archives have 
taken this approach, with the theatres themselves maintaining their own archives, instead of 
donating it to a local repository to Òkeep it in the familyÓ and for their own reference uses. 
Advocacy for theatre archives and collections is just as important. Since the live performance 
itself is intangible, collecting the documents and materials made on the journey there are 
important to collect to help support scholarship in a number of fields (Smith, 2013, p. 61). 
Although video recordings exist, due to rules set forth by the ActorsÕ Equity Association they 
cannot be put online, except in short segments, which can limit their research value and cause 
frustration. Therefore, collecting other tangible items from theatres is important to help support, 
educate, and contribute to outreach events to the community, while also advocating for the 
archiveÕs value and importance to the theatres. </br>
In a way, the most important way a theatre archive can advocate its collections and use is 
through the continued research done by theatre artists who become inspired by the holdings and 
through the impact these shows have on the audience. Since different areas of the theatre 
research different items, having a wide collection is crucial for all members of the crew and 
actors to gain use out of the archive. This allows them to compare notes later for cross discipline 
collaboration and allow them to Òcombine old and new information (research, observations, 
memories, experiences, relationships) in unique ways,Ó creating a new experience for the 
audience each and every time (Medaille, 2010, p. 345). Creating this environment for the 
audience to experience new and original theatre helps create relationships which can help spread 
the reputation of the theatre and its archive, which is a form of advocacy. By tying the two 
venues (the archive and the theatre) together, a new model is built, allowing them to work 
together and produce new, exciting content, while also not forgetting or diminishing their past. </br>
### The American Theatre Archive Project 
A combination of the themes presented above, the American Theatre Archive Project (ATAP), 
officially inaugurated in November 2010, is a subgroup of the American Society for Theatre 
Research (ASTR) and the Theatre Library Association (TLA). First initiated at the 2009 ASTR-
TLA joint conference, the main goals of the project were to Òprepare archival guidelines for 
theatre companies so they could become aware of the value of their own records, assist theatre 
staff in maintaining their own archive or find partnerships, find out how theatre archives are used 
in academic settings, and how theatre and ILS students can become involvedÓ in this project, 
with each team (Brady & Koffler, 2015, p. 106). Inspired by the Dance Heritage Coalition and 
the New Zealand Theatre Archives Project, Susan Brady and Ken Cerniglia took charge, and 
worked to develop the guidelines and goals for the proposed project. </br>
After a year of planning and development, ATAP was born, with a main focus of raising 
awareness in theatre communities and educating theatre company staff in how to retain, care for, 
and archive their records, rather than just helping acquire the records for various local 
repositories (Brady & Koffler, 2015, p. 106). By fall of 2010, there were a number of teams in 
the United States and one in Canada, pulled together by an interest survey which was sent out 
(Brady & Koffler, 2015, p. 107). With so many excited and willing Òteams,Ó guidelines and 
procedures were developed. Different committees were formed to help lead ATAP, as well as 
help things run smoothly between the teams and committee members. Together, they created a 
strategic plan, a brochure to hand out to interested theatre companies, and a brief handbook to 
hand out to initial sites (Brady & Koffler, 2015, p. 107-8). The first test of the project began in 
fall of 2011 in New York City (NYC), where a workshop ÒscriptÓ was given to archivist and 
NYC team members (Brady & Koffler, 2015, p. 108). Versions of this workshop have been 
given across the country to help spread the word and mission of ATAP. </br>
With the NYC workshop seen as a success, ATAP continued to grow. An official manual to 
ATAP was published on their site in August of 2013, and an Initiation Program to help teams get 
started has been developed, and even awards grants to help a theatre company begin archiving 
their materials. ATAP has kept growing over the years, with 16 current regional teams 
nationwide, becoming an official standing committee of ASTR in 2014 (Brady & Koffler, 2015, 
p. 113). Meeting every year for an update at the ASTR- TLA annual meeting, ATAP is still 
growing and developing, helping more and more theatres nationwide. </br>
Different teams function in different ways. Some are approached by theatres who have heard of 
ATAP and are curious to get involved; with others, the team leader approaches theatres in their 
area and tells them about the project. Some may have little going on due to circumstances out of 
their control, and others may have projects which have been going on since ATAP was founded. 
One project which has evolved is the Pacific Northwest team, which was one of the first founded 
back in 2009. Instead of working with individual cities or states, they decided to create a regional 
team, due to lack of archivists in the area and the size of the region, which also lead to online 
meetings to keep in touch and up to date on projects (Brady & Koffler, 2015, p. 114). Over the 
years, the Northwest team Òdeveloped the confidence and experience to work directly with 
theatre companies and approach external funders for support through a fairly lengthy processÓ 
(Brady & Koffler, 2015, p. 117-119). This included a survey of existing collections throughout 
the Northwest, outreach and promotion efforts, and creating new connections with theatres. 
While the Northwest team is one of the more documented teams, other teams are working along 
the same lines as well. Some teams, such as the New York team, have their own websiteÑ
separate from the overall ATAP websiteÑ which keeps team members updated about ongoing 
projects, new projects, and meeting minutes. </br>

### North Carolina and the American Theatre Archive Project 
North Carolina has had an ATAP regional team since around 2012-2013. While not yet at the 
scale it wants to be, the teamÕs goals remain the same: to create an archive for the University of 
North Carolina at Chapel HillÕs performing arts groups, ranging from PlayMakers to the UNC 
Opera group to all the various performing arts groups on campus, with some dream of expanding 
to all of the Triangle area of North Carolina. Formed by Dr. Adam Versenyi of UNC at Chapel 
Hill and a theatre professor from Duke University, the NC ATAP team set forth to determine the 
best way to start the project. Initially, feelers were sent out to theatre companies around the state. 
Soon after, they realized trying to work across the entire state was too big of a goal for such a 
small team and decided to focus on UNCÕs Department of Dramatic Art and PlayMakers 
Repertory Company archive, due to their historical significance as being the Òsecond oldest 
theatre department in the countryÓ (ÒAbout Us | UNC Department of Dramatic Art,Ó n.d.). While 
some of its records are held on UNCÕs campus, there are other records they wish to have 
accessible for themselves, to be able to reference quickly when needed. </br>
Being involved with ATAP since its inception, Dr. A. Versenyi volunteered to be the team 
leader, which he sees as an Òextension of [his] dramaturgical workÓ (personal communication, 
October 12, 2017). In fall 2014, the Community Archives class taught by Dr. Denise Anthony, 
offered at the School of Information and Library Science (SILS) at UNC became involved, 
choosing PlayMakers to be their practicum site. Other people from SILS and the University 
Libraries were involved as well, including the interim dean of SILS, Dr. Barbara Moran and staff 
from University Archives and Davis Library, along with a temporary staff member of Carolina 
Performing Arts. Together, they discussed possible issues which might occur, goals, and how 
best to carry out the project. The Community Archives class inventoried materials which were 
already in the ÒarchiveÓ within the Center for Dramatic Art (CDA) and compiled a report with 
suggestions of what to do next, with a full inventory and best practices suggested. </br>
Due to various circumstances, after the final report in 2014 by the class, ATAP and the CDA 
archive were put on the back burner, to be picked up again in the future. During this process, 
other people involved with the project had to drop out for various reasons, leaving the project 
mainly to Dr. Versenyi, who also was a member of the ATAP steering committee for three years, 
acting as liaison between ATAP and ASTR. In the fall of 2016, interest in picking up and 
investing in the project sparked, and in mid-2017 really picked up, with a SILS graduate student 
expressing interest in the project and helping the CDA develop it further. Since Wilson Library 
on UNC campus holds a number of early Carolina PlaymakerÕs materials, it was decided to focus 
the in-house CDA archive on the past 40 years of PlayMakers history and productions done by 
various groups of the Department of Dramatic Art over the years. </br>
Working on this project is what inspired the author for the topic of this master's paper, to see 
how ATAP can grow within the Triangle region of North Carolina, by conducting a survey of 
current in-house archives local theatres might have, and interviewing select theatre companies to 
gage their interest in an archive and what materials they would want to collect in one to represent 
their company as a whole.
