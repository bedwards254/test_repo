## Introduction </br>
 Ever see a theatre production and wish you could relive it, or see the thought processes behind 
the design or drafts of costume sketches? Have you thought there might be an archive for this 
sort of thing? Theatre archives are a thing many have not heard of, yet they exist in dark corners 
of theatres all over the world. From playbills to set and costume designs to posters, these 
materials pile up and show the compiled history of the theatres which hold them. Some are held 
in-house, some in a wider community archive, and some even exist inside larger institutions, 
such as a university library or special collections. Others exist in private collections of those who 
worked in these theatres and look fondly back on them. However, by being separate, the archive 
is decentralized and the whole history of the theatre is scattered, making it hard to have a full 
narrative of the company. </br>

 This is where the American Theatre Archive Project (ATAP) comes in. Supporting the archives 
of an inherently ephemeral art is a courageous endeavor, and it takes a village made up of 
archivist and theatre practitioners alike. ATAP is comprised of regional teams, which go out and 
consult with theatres to help them come up with a plan for their archival materials. This plan can 
either be donation to a repository, in which case ATAP will help arrange, or create their own 
archive, which ATAP representatives and team members will help guide them through the 
process and provide resources and assistance when needed. North Carolina has a regional team, 
with the team leader from the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. This central location 
in the state, and a partnership with Duke, seems to be ideal for the project to take shape. 
However, due to circumstances beyond its control, the team has not been able to do as much as 
they have wanted in the years they have existed, excluding an interest survey at the beginning of 
the project. </br>

 While there is an abundance of theatres within the Triangle (Raleigh, Durham, Chapel Hill) of 
North Carolina, not a lot of them have archives, or at least publicly known archives. What I 
intend to look into is the presence, if any, of theatre archives in the Triangle area of North 
Carolina, and also to see if these theatres are aware of programs such as ATAP to help them start 
one for their company if they so wish. </br>

### Research Questions 
* Do local Triangle theatres (professional and amateur) know about ATAP, and if so, how 
have they interacted with ATAP/benefitted from this knowledge? 
*	How has ATAP influenced the Triangle theatre scene, if at all? </br>

## Literature Review </br>
To understand theatre archives, an explanation of community archives and performing arts 
archives/special collections is needed. Another important aspect to be considered is why these 
types of collections are important to help preserve the cultural memory of a theatre or 
surrounding community. This section will end with a summary of the American Theatre Archive 
Project (ATAP) as a whole, and a brief overview of the history and work done by the North 
Carolina team specifically. </br>

### Community Archives </br>
The impact and awareness of community archives has become more and more recognized in 
professional literature over the past 10 years. From implementation, to building, to evaluation, 
the archives field has seen this trend grow, with new initiatives being thought up every week. 
The term "community archive," as defined by Joanna Newman in 2011, represents the 
"collections of archival records that originate in a community...and whose collection, 
maintenance and use involves active participation of that community" (p. 38). The mention of 
maintenance and use in this definition shows the importance of community archives, and how 
they should exist independently of the institution which helped create them. Funding is always a 
factor in how these archives continue but having someone "with skills and possibly specialist 
services" supported in order to not lose the "passion and connection...brought by enthusiasts" is 
just as important<a href="#anchor1"><sup>1</sup></a>. Bringing the community together at the beginning and 
encouraging interest in the archive can help lay a foundation to help support the archive later on. </br>

This impact is felt most when a "gap" in the narrative is filled; a group underrepresented in the 
community places their mark in history, a forgotten, or misremembered, piece of the past is 
uncovered, or someone discovers new information about their own family. These moments bring 
together communities and excite them about what else their collective history might uncover. 
Communities allowed to make "collective decisions about what is of enduring value to them, 
shape collective memories of their own pasts, and control the means through which stories about 
their past are constructed," create more complete archives, and end up being more useful to the 
community in the long run, due to the input from the beginning<a href="#anchor2"><sup>2</sup></a>. Community archives can help build a larger, more complete history of a place, institution, or group with these stories which come to light, providing a stronger sense of self value and worth. The impact of saying "we were here," and having materials and history to back 
up that claim, especially if previously undocumented, adds to the value of a community and can 
encourage them to keep saying "I am here," adding to their identity<a href="#anchor3"><sup>3</sup></a>. 
Bringing forward these stories help communities define themselves and see themselves in a 
different light, and in a different way in how they interact with the world around them. </br>

Mostly supported by institutions in getting started with a community archive, what happens 
when the institution must pull-away from the project to work on others? Who will keep the 
archive alive and running, and making it a worthwhile investment for the community? Has there 
even been an impact to which people would want to keep it running? Coming up with ways to 
keep the archive active is a challenge most community archives face once their founding partner 
pulls back for whatever reason. Being an agent for your cause is important, and a "participatory 
approach" can help those left in charge to navigate these programs head-on. </br>

A "participatory approach" involves allowing different views of "custody and management, 
and...archival practice, and of collection and value [that] are considered and embraced"<a href="#anchor4"><sup>4</sup></a>. This leads to a wider area of thought and acceptance to really make their 
community archive their own, especially if those leading it are open to these ideas. This 
approach can also open up the possibilities of partnerships with other similar institutions, or even 
with local businesses, to help support and nurture these archives. By partnering with businesses, 
other groups, or even schools, this collaboration can help foster a "wider sense of ownership and 
responsibility toward the archive and the archive service," which can help sustain interest in the 
long run<a href="#anchor5"><sup>5</sup></a>. This approach also gives community members the 
chance "to speak for themselves and decide whether they wish to be included [in the archive]," 
which feeds into letting them control their own community narrative and how they are 
represented in history<a href="#anchor6"><sup>6</sup></a>. This also allows for the community to 
have a chance to speak and let their voices be heard in their own history, while shaping it to 
impact the history of other communities around them. The same could be said for theatre 
performances, and the buildings which they are in. </br>

### Performing Arts Collections in Archives </br>

Performing arts collections have been in libraries and special collections for some time now, 
with the most notable being the New York Public Library for the Performing Arts and the Harry 
Ransom Center in Austin, Texas. Ranging from music to theatre to dance, these collections tend 
to feature a wide variety of formats, from AV materials to dance notation to dramaturgy notes to 
set models and costumes. </br>

Though the materials found in collections themselves have not changed much over the past 50 
years, approaches to these materials have varied, especially in how they are used and cared for. 
An article on theatre librarianship by George Freedley in 1962 shines light on how three students 
in a workshop would handle performing arts materials coming in to different settings, which 
provides insight into priorities and levels of importance<a href="#anchor7"><sup>7</sup></a>. The students discussed 
the different spaces which their theatre collections resided in, ranging from public libraries to a 
theatre library, specific to a company or club, and what they would do with items such as 
playbills, books, photographs, and original designs<a href="#anchor8"><sup>8</sup></a>. Comparing these 
recommendations from the students to articles written on performing arts archives today show 
how far performing arts collections have come, in terms of people interested in them and what 
they contain. </br>

Performing arts archives and collections have evolved over time, as well as the challenges in 
"creating and curating representations of an ephemeral art form," since these representations 
vary from art form to art form<a href="#anchor9"><sup>9</sup></a>. With the evolution of 
technology, performances have evolved as well, becoming more complex and harder to capture 
in a single form. What used to be just a script and costumes is now projections, lighting plots, 
scenic panels, and fly cues. Though there is no formal standard on how to represent these types 
of collections, the formation and evolution of professional organizations have helped archivists 
realize the "standardization of practice was possible without compromising the uniqueness of 
collections"<a href="#anchor10"><sup>10</sup></a>. This has allowed archivists nationwide to create a general 
standard, and to still be able to represent their collections in their own way, based upon what 
types of materials they have and the institutional knowledge of how they might be used. 
A question which plagues theatre archives can also be applied to community and "pop-up" 
archives. How to capture all of these moving elements faithfully, and in full detail? For 
performing arts archives, this can refer to different performances and audience reactions or to 
each rendition of the script as different parts are cut and added back in throughout the rehearsal 
process, capturing each change as it moves. These questions are also asked of community 
archivists, especially those which form around protests or other highly publicized emotional 
events, such as Occupy Wall Street. These dramatic events cause archivists to ask, "How do you 
capture the mood of the time or reflect what it meant to take part in or live through such 
experiences?"<a href="#anchor11"><sup>11</sup></a>. Recreating the experience of actually being there is 
nigh impossible, but at the core, this is what archivists want their collections to capture - the 
feelings and the atmosphere of those who were. However, records and accounts are constantly 
evolving, in both settings, with new items and viewpoints being donated at all times, capturing a 
wide range of perspectives. For communities, this means adding in a wider set of experiences 
and drawing connections from other items in collections. For performing arts archives, this 
includes different accounts and reflections of one performance of a show, or different 
interpretations of a singular source material as it continues to be performed<a href="#anchor12"><sup>12</sup></a>. Both types of archives must be open to constant change and use to be considered 
effective and relevant to their respective communities. </br>

Choosing what to keep in a performing arts archive can vary by what the particular focus is, what 
materials are available, and the resources needed to help maintain the collections in the best 
shape possible. These can include audio and video recordings, "manuscripts, photographs, and 
artwork" related to theatres in these collections, which can help "document and support research"<a href="#anchor13"><sup>13</sup></a>. However, these can also include items such as set models, costumes, 
scripts, and even potentially props from specific shows, if deemed important enough. These 
materials, along with ephemeral items, help historians "reconstruct what Gordon Craig describes 
as the artistry of theatre: the 'action, scene, and voice'," which helps bring the production to life 
in the researcher's mind<a href="#anchor14"><sup>14</sup></a>. However, deciding what to keep 
from a donation to fully represent a performance can be a challenge. </br>

A poster by Kathryn J. Hujda at the Society of American Archivists Annual Meeting 2017, titled 
ÒBut is it Archival? Determining Research Value,Ó broke down the decision process, along with 
how the term "research value" can differ between different collections. For example, she chose 
to list items with "permanent research value" for both the Literary Archives and the Performing 
Arts Archives at the University of Minnesota to show how items can have different value, 
depending on the collection they are in. For example, scrapbooks and ephemera could have more 
research value to those with a performing arts focus, rather than to researchers with a literary 
focus<a href="#anchor15"><sup>15</sup></a>. This breakdown really showcases what researchers find valuable, and 
the process she uses to determine if an item which comes in would be helpful to future research. 
Research value is vital to consider, since otherwise, there could be materials in the archive which 
don't fully help a researcher understand a show or overwhelms them to the point where they 
can't find any information. With the mix of materials found in these archives (mentioned 
previously), items range from small and seemingly insignificant, to larger items, vital to 
understanding a decision made for a certain production of a show by the director or designers. 
However, even with all this information, there can still be aspects missing from the record, such 
as the "subtle interactions between artist, venue, and audience that add character and vitality to 
live art," which cannot be replicated, and varies from performance to performance<a href="#anchor16"><sup>16</sup></a>. This is where records such as audience narratives or responses 
in journals can come in handy, and for stage and house manager reports to be collected as well. 
These are all different types of data, while not considered data by some, which can be important 
to researchers wishing to find the impact of a specific show or performance. Context is also 
important to consider, taking in outside factors such as the "social, political, economic, and 
artistic contexts" to fully understand a performance and why certain choices were made in 
response to the surrounding climate<a href="#anchor17"><sup>17</sup></a>. Audience reaction also falls into the 
context field, with each audience reacting differently and each performance shaping and 
responding to the energy provided by the audience. </br>

Since "performance is something that does not last...[and this] is exactly what fascinates theatre 
practitioners and scholars alike," the research process for these groups is influenced by this fact<a href="#anchor18"><sup>18</sup></a>. Accepting that performance is ephemeral can help inspire new 
interpretations of classic works, creating a new experience each time for audiences. Another 
unique aspect to these archives is that "performing arts librarians and archivists are often 
themselves practitioners," which brings a different "level of interest and engagement to the 
research process"<a href="#anchor19"><sup>19</sup></a>. This personal touch helps elevate the work of a 
researcher with these connections and experiences provided by the archivist. It can also help in 
explaining certain aspects of a lighting or stage plan to users, who might not have the 
background in theatre to fully understand the technical side of things, or fully dissect costume or 
set sketches<a href="#anchor20"><sup>20</sup></a>. This knowledge of both theatre and archival work also lends 
itself to better advocacy for both disciplines, by knowing how to engage an audience, and how to 
preserve history and make it accessible for future use. </br>

### Advocacy for Community Archives and Theatre Archives </br>

Memory is important to the human race; stories we pass down shape who we are and those who 
come after us and their views of the world. Sometimes, these memories are lost through war, 
budget cuts, or even pure neglect. This is where advocacy for collections, especially community 
archives, and for the root from which they stem, comes in as an important aspect of the arts and 
archives both. Hackman proclaims he thinks of "advocacy as an investment we make when we 
intentionally and strategically educate and engage individuals and organizations so they in turn 
will support our work," which can be seen in the continued existence and growth of community 
and theatre archives<a href="#anchor21"><sup>21</sup></a>. Think of a successful theatre you know, either 
locally run, or a university or regional theatre; what do they do to stay successful? They engage 
with the community around them, offer community or summer classes, and bring together people 
from all walks of life, gaining supporters and loyal audience members by producing content 
people want to see. </br>

Archives are similar - they bring in new users all the time with their collections, they engage the 
community with outreach events, and they gain a loyal base who will help support them in rough 
times. If it's a community archive, this support goes even deeper, maybe even to the governing 
level, as seen in Lisa Collins Shortall's 2016 article on the County Offaly archives in Ireland. 
Even with all this support, advocacy is important to include in normal operations, making sure 
your mission and message are clear on all fronts and maintain strong relationships, not just to the 
archive or theatre itself. Community archives in particular have an importance in "shaping the 
local historical narrative, collective identity and social memory of a locality"<a href="#anchor22"><sup>22</sup></a>. In a way, where institutional archives have gaps, community archives can form 
and fill in those gaps, by collecting unheard narratives and objects institutions may not be able to 
take in at a certain time. Location could also play a part in this, with the "desire to physically 
secure...archival collections in a geographical provenance-based location" showing the 
importance of the collections to the community and how they would like to have them on hand, 
to both care for and to use at will<a href="#anchor23"><sup>23</sup></a>. Some theatre archives have 
taken this approach, with the theatres themselves maintaining their own archives, instead of 
donating it to a local repository to "keep it in the family" and for their own reference uses. 
Advocacy for theatre archives and collections is just as important. Since the live performance 
itself is intangible, collecting the documents and materials made on the journey there are 
important to collect to help support scholarship in a number of fields<a href="#anchor24"><sup>24</sup></a>. 
Although video recordings exist, due to rules set forth by the Actors' Equity Association they 
cannot be put online, except in short segments, which can limit their research value and cause 
frustration. Therefore, collecting other tangible items from theatres is important to help support, 
educate, and contribute to outreach events to the community, while also advocating for the 
archiveÕs value and importance to the theatres. </br>

In a way, the most important way a theatre archive can advocate its collections and use is 
through the continued research done by theatre artists who become inspired by the holdings and 
through the impact these shows have on the audience. Since different areas of the theatre 
research different items, having a wide collection is crucial for all members of the crew and 
actors to gain use out of the archive. This allows them to compare notes later for cross discipline 
collaboration and allow them to "combine old and new information (research, observations, 
memories, experiences, relationships) in unique ways," creating a new experience for the 
audience each and every time<a href="#anchor25"><sup>25</sup></a>. Creating this environment for the 
audience to experience new and original theatre helps create relationships which can help spread 
the reputation of the theatre and its archive, which is a form of advocacy. By tying the two 
venues (the archive and the theatre) together, a new model is built, allowing them to work 
together and produce new, exciting content, while also not forgetting or diminishing their past. </br>

### The American Theatre Archive Project </br>

A combination of the themes presented above, the American Theatre Archive Project (ATAP), 
officially inaugurated in November 2010, is a subgroup of the American Society for Theatre 
Research (ASTR) and the Theatre Library Association (TLA). First initiated at the 2009 ASTR-
TLA joint conference, the main goals of the project were to "prepare archival guidelines for 
theatre companies so they could become aware of the value of their own records, assist theatre 
staff in maintaining their own archive or find partnerships, find out how theatre archives are used 
in academic settings, and how theatre and ILS students can become involved" in this project, 
with each team<a href="#anchor26"><sup>26</sup></a>. Inspired by the Dance Heritage Coalition and 
the New Zealand Theatre Archives Project, Susan Brady and Ken Cerniglia took charge, and 
worked to develop the guidelines and goals for the proposed project. </br>

After a year of planning and development, ATAP was born, with a main focus of raising 
awareness in theatre communities and educating theatre company staff in how to retain, care for, 
and archive their records, rather than just helping acquire the records for various local 
repositories<a href="#anchor27"><sup>27</sup></a>. By fall of 2010, there were a number of teams in 
the United States and one in Canada, pulled together by an interest survey which was sent out<a href="#anchor28"><sup>28</sup></a>. With so many excited and willing "teams," guidelines and 
procedures were developed. Different committees were formed to help lead ATAP, as well as 
help things run smoothly between the teams and committee members. Together, they created a 
strategic plan, a brochure to hand out to interested theatre companies, and a brief handbook to 
hand out to initial sites<a href="#anchor29"><sup>29</sup></a>. The first test of the project began in 
fall of 2011 in New York City (NYC), where a workshop "script" was given to archivist and 
NYC team members<a href="#anchor30"><sup>30</sup></a>. Versions of this workshop have been 
given across the country to help spread the word and mission of ATAP. </br>

With the NYC workshop seen as a success, ATAP continued to grow. An official manual to 
ATAP was published on their site in August of 2013, and an Initiation Program to help teams get 
started has been developed, and even awards grants to help a theatre company begin archiving 
their materials. ATAP has kept growing over the years, with 16 current regional teams 
nationwide, becoming an official standing committee of ASTR in 2014<a href="#anchor31"><sup>31</sup></a>. Meeting every year for an update at the ASTR- TLA annual meeting, ATAP is still 
growing and developing, helping more and more theatres nationwide. </br>

Different teams function in different ways. Some are approached by theatres who have heard of 
ATAP and are curious to get involved; with others, the team leader approaches theatres in their 
area and tells them about the project. Some may have little going on due to circumstances out of 
their control, and others may have projects which have been going on since ATAP was founded. 
One project which has evolved is the Pacific Northwest team, which was one of the first founded 
back in 2009. Instead of working with individual cities or states, they decided to create a regional 
team, due to lack of archivists in the area and the size of the region, which also lead to online 
meetings to keep in touch and up to date on projects<a href="#anchor32"><sup>32</sup></a>. Over the 
years, the Northwest team "developed the confidence and experience to work directly with 
theatre companies and approach external funders for support through a fairly lengthy process"<a href="#anchor33"><sup>33</sup></a>. This included a survey of existing collections throughout 
the Northwest, outreach and promotion efforts, and creating new connections with theatres. 
While the Northwest team is one of the more documented teams, other teams are working along 
the same lines as well. Some teams, such as the New York team, have their own website\-
separate from the overall ATAP website\- which keeps team members updated about ongoing 
projects, new projects, and meeting minutes. </br>

### North Carolina and the American Theatre Archive Project </br>

North Carolina has had an ATAP regional team since around 2012-2013. While not yet at the 
scale it wants to be, the team's goals remain the same: to create an archive for the University of 
North Carolina at Chapel Hill's performing arts groups, ranging from PlayMakers to the UNC 
Opera group to all the various performing arts groups on campus, with some dream of expanding 
to all of the Triangle area of North Carolina. Formed by Dr. Adam Versenyi of UNC at Chapel 
Hill and a theatre professor from Duke University, the NC ATAP team set forth to determine the 
best way to start the project. Initially, feelers were sent out to theatre companies around the state. 
Soon after, they realized trying to work across the entire state was too big of a goal for such a 
small team and decided to focus on UNCÕs Department of Dramatic Art and PlayMakers 
Repertory Company archive, due to their historical significance as being the "second oldest 
theatre department in the country"<a href="#anchor34"><sup>34</sup></a>. While 
some of its records are held on UNC's campus, there are other records they wish to have 
accessible for themselves, to be able to reference quickly when needed. </br>

Being involved with ATAP since its inception, Dr. A. Versenyi volunteered to be the team 
leader, which he sees as an "extension of [his] dramaturgical work"<a href="#anchor35"><sup>35</sup></a>. In fall 2014, the Community Archives class taught by Dr. Denise Anthony, 
offered at the School of Information and Library Science (SILS) at UNC became involved, 
choosing PlayMakers to be their practicum site. Other people from SILS and the University 
Libraries were involved as well, including the interim dean of SILS, Dr. Barbara Moran and staff 
from University Archives and Davis Library, along with a temporary staff member of Carolina 
Performing Arts. Together, they discussed possible issues which might occur, goals, and how 
best to carry out the project. The Community Archives class inventoried materials which were 
already in the "archive" within the Center for Dramatic Art (CDA) and compiled a report with 
suggestions of what to do next, with a full inventory and best practices suggested. </br>

Due to various circumstances, after the final report in 2014 by the class, ATAP and the CDA 
archive were put on the back burner, to be picked up again in the future. During this process, 
other people involved with the project had to drop out for various reasons, leaving the project 
mainly to Dr. Versenyi, who also was a member of the ATAP steering committee for three years, 
acting as liaison between ATAP and ASTR. In the fall of 2016, interest in picking up and 
investing in the project sparked, and in mid-2017 really picked up, with a SILS graduate student 
expressing interest in the project and helping the CDA develop it further. Since Wilson Library 
on UNC campus holds a number of early Carolina Playmaker's materials, it was decided to focus 
the in-house CDA archive on the past 40 years of PlayMakers history and productions done by 
various groups of the Department of Dramatic Art over the years. </br>

Working on this project is what inspired the author for the topic of this master's paper, to see 
how ATAP can grow within the Triangle region of North Carolina, by conducting a survey of 
current in-house archives local theatres might have, and interviewing select theatre companies to 
gage their interest in an archive and what materials they would want to collect in one to represent 
their company as a whole. </br>

## Methods
To start my research phase, I compiled of list of 24 theatre companies and groups around Raleigh-Durham-Chapel Hill (Triangle) area of North Carolina. I used their public facing websites to identify the general managers and artistic directors. This is who I would contact for my survey, if there was no general email to contact the group or theatre. I created my survey using Qualtrics software through UNC, after creating the questions in a Microsoft Word document. I used Qualtrics due to its UNC log-in credentials, which made it secure, as compared to a service such as Google Forms. The tools Qualtrics has to analyze data was also a factor in choosing this platform to host my survey.</br>

I sent out the survey in mid-January (See Appendix 1) to see if the theatres have an archive, if they would be interested in having one, and if they would be willing to talk with me further about their archival materials. The main goal of the survey was to learn more about the theatre’s history, see their current archival status, gather statistics about what they have on site and where it is stored, and to gauge their interest in donating materials or managing it themselves. I closed the survey after three weeks and sent out a reminder email halfway through the time span to generate more responses. I received a total of 12 responses, detailed more in the next section.</br>

I followed up with five individual theatres for further in-person, semi-structured interviews with the person who took to the survey, as well as one outside theatre (See Appendix 2 for interview questions). Three of them responded to the follow-up email to schedule a time to talk. The interviews took place in February and March of 2018, with all information being synthesized and analyzed by mid-March 2018. Due to timing and travel constraints, all of the representatives were interviewed over the phone, with copious notes made.</br>

These interviews were audio recorded only when the interviewee consented to it, and extensive notes were taken. The phone interviews were recorded using Call Recorder by Green Apple Studio, found in the Google Play Store. The free app also allowed for the file to be sent to my computer through email, which was then downloaded to my personal computer with the email deleted to safeguard the recording and information it contains.</br>

### Rationale
A survey was chosen as an initial method, since it allowed me to reach out to a wide range of people, without having to approach them individually in person. It also allowed a low-pressure environment for the respondents to take the survey, since they could do it when they had time to and without me observing them. This allowed for “a rapid response rate and increased respondent flexibility” when I initially sent out the survey, and again with the reminder<a href="#anchor36"><sup>36</sup></a>. A survey also allowed for a wide range of questions, from short answer to multiple choice, which is not done as easily in interviews. The email (See Appendix 3) sent with the survey link explained the background of the study, the objectives and process of the study, and why they specifically were being sent the email, as well as an option to not take the survey, as it was voluntary. </br>

Semi-structured interviews were chosen as a follow-up method, since it allowed me to talk with the respondents more about their materials, along with their interest in the American Theatre Archive Project (ATAP). The questions for these interviews start off with background information about the theatre, then flow into questions about the theatre’s archives (if they have them) and what materials they contain. The interview questions then shift to focus more on the American Theatre Archive Project to see how familiar the interviewee might be with the Project, as well as their thoughts on how the project could be better at reaching out to theatres. The interview ends with a question asking how the interviewees view the intersection of theatre and archives and how these two groups could work together in the future.</br>

Semi-structured interviews allowed the conversation to happen naturally and for new questions to arise based off the participants’ answers. This welcomed natural curiosity and for the conversation to flourish in areas it might not have otherwise if the interviews were fully structured. As Rubin and Rubin said in their 2005 article, this method also allowed for the chance to “probe[s] and follow-up[s] to obtain the necessary detail, depth and [thick] description”<a href="#anchor37"><sup>37</sup></a>. This helped expand my research and explore areas I might not have considered initially.</br>

### Limitations
Since there are a limited number of theatres in the Triangle area, I started out with a small pool of people to contact, which was emphasized by the number of responses I received for my survey. Having a small number is desirable for reaching out to individual theatres for in-person interviews, but harder in terms of surveys, since they may not be interested in responding, or may forget about it. There was also the challenge of not knowing how old some of the people I was contacting were, so being very clear about the necessity of being 18 or older was needed. There were also limitations in how many people were interested in talking with me post-survey and making our schedules line-up to conduct the follow-up interview. </br>

### Analyzing Methods
Once my survey closed in mid-February, I began to analyze the data collected. Though there were few responses, valuable information was gathered from those who did respond. To analyze the responses, I used tools available in Qualtrics to view responses against one another, make comparisons, and draw conclusions, which discussed in
detail below.</br> 

After my interviews, I went back and analyzed both the notes I took and the audio recordings to look for similar themes and to see what additional information I had collected. Though the interviews were to gain a deeper understanding of what materials these theatres had and their knowledge of the American Theatre Archive Project, I also gathered a sense if those I had talked with had any interest in exploring ATAP more and offered to provide them with contact information.</br></br>

## Findings and Analysis 
### Survey Findings and Analysis
I left my survey open for four weeks and received 12 responses overall. While this was an impressive number due to the amount of people I initially sent the survey to, there were only five viable responses. One participant emailed me after taking the survey in apology for participating even though they were under 18; this response was deleted. One response was a repeat from a participant who responded each time the email was sent out; this was my fault, as I was not clear enough in my reminder email, and the second response was deleted after checking to determine none of the answers had changed between surveys. Three responses were false starts and only made it past the consent question. These were deleted since there was no valuable data collected. Two responses were deleted, because even though the participants started the survey, they did not complete it; keeping them in would have skewed the data collected.</br> 

There was a pretty even response rate from the different towns within the Triangle region, with Raleigh having the most and Durham and Carrboro also being represented. Those who responded to the survey were also varied in the job titles they had; no titles were repeated. I received more responses from higher-level theatre employees, such as Artistic Directors and Producers, and one Box Office Manager. This shows the wide range of people who answer general email addresses of these companies, as only two of those who responded received direct emails from me in regards to the survey.</br> 

The majority of respondents have been with their current theatre company for 10-15 years; two for a shorter time frame, and one who has been there for over 20 years (See Figure 1). With the time span in mind, I was surprised to find the identified archival material was stored mainly in their office, or “stored in closets throughout the building.” One surprising answer to the question of where archival materials are stored was the response “some is at the home of members,” as well as in their office or online. This demonstrates a trust of the company in their members, as well as the loyalty the members have to the company to keep up with the theatre enough over time to help create an archive.</br>

Even though the respondents identified the archival material they do have, either physical or digital, the majority of respondents do not have experience or knowledge of theatre archives (See Figure 2). A respondent did say their company has an “official” archive; in the interview stage, they mentioned it is not public knowledge, but people are welcome to ask about it and view it. Interestingly, one participant stated their archival materials were physical only, no digital items. I found this to be very telling in what they consider archival materials to be, since there is so much done now digitally, such as poster and program designs. Other respondents mentioned there were both types of materials, with digital materials mainly being stored on their computers (there was no distinction between work or personal), with one company specifying they use Dropbox as archival storage.</br>

The most unanticipated finding came from the last question of the survey, which asked if there was a conscious collecting of materials and if there were any intentions to donate the materials somewhere in the future. The majority of respondents marked they were interested in donating to a repository in the future (See Figure 3). This was very exciting to me, as it allowed me to follow-up in the interviews where they were interested in donating their materials, and to measure their interest in the American Theatre Archive Project to see if a repository could be connected with them. </br>

One participant responded no to the last survey question, which I assume was to the consciously collecting part of it. They expounded upon their responses briefly in the request for their information if they were interested in being contacted for an interview. They mentioned there is currently not a “theater production/department,” but they do “host theater productions” in their venue, just not producing them. This insight was very helpful, and I appreciate the respondent making note of it.</br>

### Interview Findings and Analysis</br>
After the survey closed, I sent out emails to those who indicated they were interested in talking with me more about their theatre’s archives and the American Theatre Archive Project. Four people emailed me back, with one asking for more information before committing to an interview. I sent the questions to them, and they responded they would get back to me if they felt they could helpfully answer the questions. Another respondent emailed back quickly and we set a time to talk the following week. The third respondent actually emailed me back with a referral to the person acting as their company’s archivist for the time being. I followed up with the referred person, explaining the project and scheduling a time to talk with them; they also asked for the interview questions in advance (See Appendix 2). I also reached out to a theatre which didn’t respond to my survey, but they were who I had in mind when I started this project. They ended up responding to my interview request near the end of my time frame, which was key for my paper.</br>

The three individuals I did speak with provided great insight into the current state of theatre archives in the Triangle. Two interviewees represented theatres in Raleigh and the other represented a theatre in Durham. Two of the theatres have been operational between 20 and 50 years, but they seemed to be in similar stages where their archives are concerned. The third theatre has been around since the 1930s and was started by the Work Project Administration. They have a longer history and represent their history through an archive they’ve started. None of the interviewees knew of the American Theatre Archive Project before my study, so I had an explanation prepared for background to help inform them for later questions. This helped them feel more comfortable answering my questions, and also provided a foundation to build their knowledge in the future.</br>

#### Burning Coal Theatre</br>
My first interview was with the respondent from Burning Coal Theatre in Raleigh, NC. As we talked, their views on theatre were revealed, as well as a history of their theatre. Burning Coal Theatre has been around since 1995, with their first show in 1996. The theatre was founded under the idea of theatre as communication, and how it “allows an artist to communicate with their community but also allows the community to speak back,” in a way other art forms can’t really facilitate (Interviewee 1, personal communication, February 12, 2018). The interviewee went on to state this idea is what they hope the legacy of the theatre will be—the communication factor and how people interact with theatre.</br>

Surprisingly, there has been a conscious effort of collecting archival materials since the beginning. However, not all of it is available to the public. The interviewee said the archive was started mainly to “keep a record...for ourselves,” rather than for the community, but acknowledges they are available if someone were to ask for them (Interviewee 1, personal communication, February 12, 2018). A bit of their history is available on their website, but the interviewee mentioned it hasn’t been updated in a while. The first 15 seasons are up on the website with posters and cast lists, but aside from being on the site, there is not a written history of Burning Coal. Along with digital materials, there are also physical materials held within the theatre itself. There are plastic bins for each season containing posters, playbills, set designs, blueprints, and reviews. While these all can be accessed, they aren’t publicized widely as being so; however, they are being added to and organized regularly.</br>

While the interviewee was very open in the beginning about their views on theatre and its place in the world, this really came out in the second half of the interview. The topic switched to the American Theatre Archive Project and the role of archives in theatres overall instead of background and history of Burning Coal. When I explained what the American Theatre Archive Project was to the interviewee, their response was “that’s pretty exciting, I never knew anyone would be interested beyond our walls” (Interviewee 1, personal communication, February 12, 2018). This shows the impact of the word spreading about the Project to local community theatres. As we continued to talk, the interviewee continued to express high interest in ATAP. They wanted to know if there was a set plan in place to start and how they could help in any measure, as well as mentioning if someone could be sent to help, it would be great.</br>

They also continued to point out how busy and small these types of theatres are, stating in the Triangle region alone, “we’ve lost something like 7 or 8 theatres in the last 15 years, all of which had buildings, had actual facilities associated with them and they're all gone now, or in one case about to be gone at the end of this season” (Interviewee 1, personal communication, February 12, 2018). This really stood out to me, since while there are around 30 community theatres identified for this research, the rate at which they are disappearing is alarming. There’s so much history with these theatres which is rapidly disappearing or inaccessible for people to utilize and learn about these special communities. They also mentioned a statistic someone with the American Dance Festival in Durham mentioned when Burning Coal first opened. It is said it takes “nine touches or connections” on the average with someone for them to “commit to your arts organization;” most who move to the Triangle leave within four years, which leads to most people “simply, literally [not knowing] we’re here” (Interviewee 1, personal communication, February 12, 2018). This could be a reason so many theatres have disappeared within the Triangle region over the past 15 years; without community support and attendance, they simply couldn’t stay afloat and keep producing shows.</br>

The last question I asked, about how theatres and archives can work together, elicited a very passionate response. They immediately responded with “people really like history...[they’re] interested in past and the theatre is not really connected to that,” which is something they hope to change (Interviewee 1, personal communication, February 12, 2018). The interviewee was really into the idea of using history to connect with new and loyal audiences alike, and thought archives are a way for that to happen. They concluded with “most of theatre, at some level or another is about history, so why not accentuate that and let that be the mechanism through which the community is introduced to all of our work,” which really seemed to sum up their feelings on the topic (Interviewee 1, personal communication, February 12, 2018). Through archives, the community could learn about the legacy and history of the theatre, while also developing an interest in the company now and in the future might even go to a show. The interviewee even provided an example of this, with Burning Coal’s spring series where they perform a series of short plays at Oakwood Ceremony in Raleigh, sharing the stories of the people who are buried there. The interviewee mentioned it’s a huge draw for people; supporting their stance of history connecting people.</br>

#### Durham Savoyards</br>
The second interviewee I talked with was a representative of the Durham Savoyards. While not the person who responded to my initial survey, the interviewee currently acts as the archivist for the theatre and was referred to me as a better person to talk with. The Durham Savoyards were interesting to learn about, especially since they have backing from the Durham Arts Council; as opposed to Burning Coal, which is completely independent. The Durham Savoyards have been around since 1963 and are part of a network of theatres which celebrate and produce works of Gilbert and Sullivan. These clubs, all called a version of Savoyards, originally started in London then migrated to the United States. The archive was started by a member who donated materials years ago, which are just now being inventoried due to time and other constraints. Some materials are on the website under the About Us section, including materials from the 50th anniversary in 2013, awards won, and items from past performances, such as posters and playbills. There is no official written history of the Durham Savoyards, but there has been a cookbook produced by members.</br>

When starting on the inventory of the most recent accession, the interviewee was surprised to learn of Durham Savoyard materials at institutions within Triangle special collections. There are materials such as playbills located at Duke and past editions of their newsletters available at UNC. The interviewee also reached out to the Durham County Public Library to potentially do an exhibit at their new branch after current renovations are complete, but they had not heard a definitive answer at the time of the interview. The interviewee expressed some concerns over the collection being split up and without a defined space, highlighting concerns about how people would know where to look for a certain item. The interviewee mentioned wanting to communicate more with these repositories to figure out a better solution for the collection as a whole.</br> 

Currently within the collection, there are a wide range of materials, from a napkin to set pieces and costumes stored in a warehouse the Savoyards use. There are also recordings of shows in a variety of formats, general acting and technical books, playbills dating back to the very first season, along with photographs and posters from productions. These are just materials from the current inventory, not including other materials which may come in or those which are there and haven’t been investigated yet. A difference between the Savoyards and Burning Coal is the Savoyards have a board which they must run decisions by for approval before reaching out to potential partners, to help protect the reputation of the company. This reflects in how they crafted their response to my question of the legacy of the theatre, which was a group effort: “Obviously bringing an appreciation and understanding of the Gilbert and Sullivan material in a community theatre, an amateur community theatre environment, but also having people experience theatre as community.” (Interviewee 2, personal communication, February 19 2018). To me, this showed their level of preparedness, as well as how they wish to represent the Savoyards to the greater population.</br>

Their answers to the American Theatre Archive Project questions were thought- provoking, since they had not known of the Project before my initial contact. There was great concern over if the Project would be “duplicating the efforts of Triangle libraries,” since “North Carolina libraries are really special and have lots of resources” (Interviewee 2, personal communication, February 19, 2018). This perspective was different than expected, but I found it to be thoughtful and respectful of the work these libraries are already doing to preserve local theatre’s histories. They also brought up the issue of funding and how long it could realistically last, along with who’s responsibility it would be to maintain it. However, they were very interested and curious in exploring the Project more, and they didn’t want to close any doors, especially those relating to the arts; any project or help is highly appreciated.</br>

In terms of how ATAP can be better at contacting new theatre groups and communicating with them effectively, they said it was more difficult to say, since every theatre is different. They recommended email as the best way to communicate with people, as well as use social media or other promotion tools to reach out. They also mentioned the power of connections and reaching out to organizations such as the Durham Arts Council, who can represent a wide variety of groups in an area. The interviewee also suggested using phone books to find theatres and to just talk with people to see what they know or what they remember; relying on people’s memories is a good way to find out who to contact.</br>

Their view of how archives and theatres can work together in the future continued to show how communication was a large part of the Savoyards mission. The interviewee was thinking large, starting out saying they envisioned a model similar to the Smithsonian, with lots of exhibits over a national network. They thought a handbook would also be helpful (I then took a moment to tell them ATAP does have a manual available online), and to have people who actually enjoy these types of collections working with them. Within this network they envision, streamlining the process and providing help or support, along with establishing a more central hub. A more surprising thing they, as an UNC School of Information and Library Science graduate, said was they thought “libraries need to do a better job explaining what they do,” in terms of helping communities and the resources they can provide (Interviewee 2, personal communication, February 19, 2018). The interviewee seemed really interested in ATAP and how projects like it can challenge people’s viewpoints of both theatres and libraries as a whole.</br>

#### Raleigh Little Theatre</br>
The third person I spoke with represented Raleigh Little Theatre (RLT). Incorporated in 1936, Raleigh Little Theatre has been a community theatre in the Triangle for a long time. There are a few full-time staff members, but most of their shows are run with the help of their large volunteer base. The person I interviewed started in 1992 as a volunteer, then became a full-time staff member for a few years and retired in 2013. However, they returned to volunteer as archivist due to their close ties formed with the community, and with knowing the history of RLT so intimately. The interviewee mentioned there was an archivist before them, but not for 20 years or so, which led to boxes being piled up and items not being organized. Right now, the interviewee is training someone to do the day-to-day tasks, since they are now out of the area. However, they still work on projects and exhibits when time permits.</br>

Surprisingly, RLT has a fairly robust and up-to-date digital archive available on their website. It contains materials from 2000 onwards, but they still save corresponding paper materials. In their archives they have materials dating back to 1932, including show folders containing playbills, photographs, publicity and reviews. The archive also contains documents of special events such as their Diva Series and Garden Tours, along with scrapbooks for each season. Together with the show folders, they have files arranged by season containing season brochures and newsletters. The interviewee has also taken the time to compile notebooks containing the histories of RLT founders and staff. This shows dedication and love the interviewee has for theatre overall, and RLT specifically. Their dedication is also shown through the fact the interviewee has completely organized the collection into the above categories for easier access to the materials, with no formal training as an archivist.</br>

When asked about their knowledge of the American Theatre Archive Project, the interviewee expressed they didn’t know about the Project, but it “sounds great” (Interviewee 3, personal communication, March 8, 2018). They said Raleigh Little Theatre’s main concern is to “turn everything into an electronic format” for easier access, especially photographs and slides (Interviewee 3, personal communication, March 8, 2018). They also mentioned the lack of time to work on the archive by full-time staff members; having people who are interested in theatre archives and willing to work would be a great resource. When asked what they would ask for ATAP’s help with, they mentioned three main objectives:</br>

1. How do we find the personnel to help?</br>
2. How do we find the technology?</br>
3. How can we store the materials more safely?</br>

Achieving these objectives would help the collection stay organized while also making it more accessible to the general public, so those who wish to see materials don’t have to go through the acting archivist to see them. The interviewee also recommended calling and reaching out through a theatre’s website or email to be the best way for those involved with the Project to establish a connection with a community theatre. They recommended this since the day-to-day work of a theatre is so slammed, they aren’t as inclined to reach out to projects such as ATAP.</br>

Their response as to how theatres and archives could work together was different, since Raleigh Little Theatre has an established archive, and has “never had any help from anybody” in doing so (Interviewee 3, personal communication, March 8, 2018). They did mention they had reached out to various institutions, such as the State Archives and the City Museum in Raleigh, but there is no active relationship with them at the moment. The interviewee did suggest universities with library science programs could coordinate with theatres in their respective areas on internships and class projects to provide experience for the students and help for the theatre. These connections and making sure the “younger generation” continues on in this work seemed to be their main concerns for the future of theatre and archives (Interviewee 3, personal communication, March 8, 2018). The interviewee mentioned they believe the younger generation has a different view and attitude toward saving things such as photographs due to technology. While this view was not brought up in the other interviews, it’s something to think about when approaching community archives.</br> 

### Discussion</br>
The idea of fostering communication and community through the theatre, either through performances or history, was prevalent in all the interviews. There seems to be a sense of responsibility for Triangle theatres to produce excellent work, but also to create a community where people are welcomed and encouraged to attend productions. Interviewee 3 even referred to the theatre as “home to thousands and thousands of people since 1936,” and wanted to make it feel like “home for those who love theatre” (Interviewee 3, personal communication, March 8, 2018). This sense of home seems important to these theatre companies and is something they want to keep alive through their archives. </br>

All of the respondents mentioned the challenge of working in and owning a small theatre, in terms of both staffing and gaining a loyal audience. Funding was also brought up as a challenge by the smaller theatres and how it affects their archiving effort, since it takes money to set up, run, and maintain an archive. However, none of them seemed overly dejected; in fact, they seemed to accept it and almost see it as a challenge. They all stated having someone from the American Theatre Archive Project, or a university. there to work with the archive would be a great help and would be greatly appreciated.</br>

It was intriguing how each interviewee briefly mentioned how they didn’t know if other theatres in the area have an archive or not. This shows an interesting disconnect between the local theatre scene in the Triangle—they aren’t as closely connected as one might expect. This could be because only one interviewed had archival materials online, while others aren’t as open with access to their archives at the current time. This is something which could be promoted more within the region.</br>

In terms of my research questions, stated at the beginning and again below, there seemed to be no knowledge of the American Theatre Archive Project to those I interviewed. My first research question was: Do local Triangle theatres (professional and amateur) know about ATAP, and if so, how have they interacted with ATAP/benefitted from this knowledge? Since the North Carolina team is led by someone associated with PlayMakers Repertory Company, it is assumed they know about the Project. Since I did not interview anyone from PlayMakers, I cannot verify this for the purposes of this study. With none of the people interviewed from amateur theatres knowing of ATAP before me contacting them for this project, the second half of my first research question was inconclusive. However, it can be assumed from the interviews these theatres might benefit from ATAP in the future.</br>

My second research question, how has ATAP influenced the Triangle theatre scene, if at all, was also not directly answered by my interviews. Since the Project is not as widely known as initially suspected, I was surprised all of the theatres I talked with had an archive of some sort. While ATAP may not have influenced the Triangle theatre community, there is still an innate desire to preserve their histories. There is also an interest in ATAP coming to the area, which indicates ATAP would be successful in the Triangle. They could have a large influence, especially with theatres who didn’t respond to my survey or newer theatres in the area. While not shown in this research, there is potential for ATAP to connect with an audience in the Triangle and have an influence in the Triangle theatre community.</br>

## Conclusions and Recommendations</br>
Through both my survey and interviews, I learned a lot about the state of archives within the local Triangle theatre scene. While there are a number of theatres and theatre groups in this region of North Carolina, a lot of them seem to have at least some archival materials, but they are unsure of what to do with them. They wish more organizations would reach out to them, through any means, since they are often too busy to do so themselves. There is a passion for the archives to continue and to have proper homes, they just aren’t 100% sure how to go about doing it at this point in time.</br>

I would say the North Carolina team of the American Theatre Archive Project reaching out to the theatres mentioned above would be a great first step, just to talk with them and figure out what they might want to do in the long run. I would recommend also trying to contact the theatres in the area who did not respond to my survey to gain a better understanding of community theatre archives as a whole in this region. This would widen the scope and allow the network to start growing. Universities such as UNC with theatre or library science programs could coordinate with local theatres to help them start their archive, or even just help scan materials to digitize them to be placed online.</br> 

There is a lot of heart in the Triangle theatre scene, and there is a desire to preserve the history located in the playhouses here. I really believe if these theatres work with various partners to make their archives available to the public and promote them, people of all ages will make their way to them and maybe even stay for a show or two.</br></br>
