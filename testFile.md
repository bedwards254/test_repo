# I am adding a line of text. Maybe I'll try encoding next! 
Testing again

# This is a h1 tag in Markdown
## This is a h2 tag in Markdown

**This shows emphasis**   
*This shows italics*   
_BUT so does this_  

Note: there needs to be 2 spaces after a sentence to show a line break. 

## I'm going to create an *unordered* list now, kthxbye
* List item one 
* Item 2
  * Look! A sub-item 
  * It's nice to know how tabs work 
* End list items

## Now I will make an *ordered* list
1. Item one
2. Item two
  1. Surprise! Sub-item
  2. This makes sense
3. End ordered list! 

## Now let's try linking to a website
This will link to the [Rose Library](<https://rose.library.emory.edu> "https://rose.library.emory.edu") site.

## This is an in-line code example
This could be `handy to know` I think. 

```Look at my code block! I'm a general, whee!```

## And now for a footnote! 
This is my footnote test <a href="#anchor1"><sup>1</sup></a> 

## Let's try a block quote: 
Someone wise once said: 
> "There is a voice inside of you  
> That whispers all day long,  
> 'I feel this is right for me,  
> I know that this is wrong.'  
> No teacher, preacher, parent, friend  
> Or wise man can decide  
> What's right for you -- just listen to  
> The voice that speaks inside."  

That someone was **Shel Silverstein**

<a id="anchor1">[1]</a> Here is my footnote (I hope).
